# From Jupiter - Rogue-like Fast-Action Game

This repository contains the 2020 end of year project for Team-3 from the course CSCI 2941 at CU Denver. We initially set out with large ambitions and gradually pulled back as we realized the full extent of what building a game entails. We originally hoped to comeplete some sort of rogue-like prototype, but considering we knew nothing about procedural generation, and considering that we were working in a relatively unsupported platform. We instead aimed to learn how to create more extensive player controls, how to animate, and how to create environements we could transition between as the player explores the world.

### What the end product contains:

To create our game, we were required to use the bare bones MonoGame platform. We successfully created a working main menu which allows you to either enter the game, or quit the program. There are two other menu systems you can enter (Highscores, Options), but neither have any actual use beside being able to change the current screen. When you enter the "game", all the player can do is walk around between environments. This is essentially the basics of what we were able to complete in the allotted time. But during this process we learned many things.

### What we learned:

We learned how to create environments using a tiled approach, and how to hand draw the tiles we needed (though we ultimately used pre-drawn assets for the environment). We learned how to animate environmental sprites and how to apply basic hitboxes to environmental pieces - this helped us prevent the player from walking through objects or out of the map, while also making the world feel a bit more vibrant/alive. We also learned how to animate player sprite-sheets, and tie those different animations to player input. By the end of the project, we were working on dash and attack systems/animations, though we never got them to a useable state. As mentioned in the section on what our project contains, we also learned how to set up a menu system and switch between states. Finally, we learned how to add music to the game, which was composed by our team.

# Final Notes

Ultimately, this project repo is a mess. For anyone looking to actually use the content contained here, it will absolutely be an uphill battle getting it to work. Thats because, not only were we terrible at managing our commits at the time this repo was made, but also because MonoGame is a depricated platform. We were beginners in the CS field when we worked on this project, and now as we are coming back many years later to provide some sort of reason to the madness, we see what sort of headache we have caused. Eventually, I (Samuel Hilfer) plan to upload some screenshots to this README to represent what we were able to receive, as well as (potentially) some notes on how to use the project yourself. For now however, this README will have to serve as proof of what we were able to create multiple years ago.
